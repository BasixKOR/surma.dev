## The project
The source is hosted on [GitHub].

## The idea
While playing around with [Amazon EC2], I realized that using a full-fleged [Debian] as a base system may be convenient but just as wasteful. The same applies to [OpenVZ] container templates. A fresh container serving a simple webpage wastes 400 MB of disk space and about 200 MB of RAM if [Apache] is used.  While trying to use [Tiny Core Linux] and similar distros as a base image (and failing at it), I felt the need for a something different.

## Why Go
[BusyBox] is a good solution to this, but it is written in C, has confusingly many applets (and options) and a webserver is – as far as I remember – not among them. It being written in C is a valid argument in the sense, that it might be vulnerable to buffer overflows and other security flaws.  Additionaly, the source code is unnecessarily hard to manage.

One of my core requirements was static linking so the footprint could be kept small and I would not have to worry about libraries. At this point I turned to [Go] for multiple reasons:

 * Go is **statically linked** by default (at least it used to be and it is easy to switch back the old behaviour. See blow).
 * Go’s **syntax is incredibly lightweight** with a great **standard library**. The code will be easy to read and maintain and a lot of boilerplate can be avoided due to the library.
 * **Native concurrency and networking** makes writing applets common for server systems quite easy. The [current implementation of a webserver][httpd] is 27 lines, 26 of which are the default applet boilerplate.  * Go is **safe**. There is no pointer arithmetics, a garbage collector and string is a native type. So remote execution holes are fairly unlikely and memory leaks not the developer’s responsibility.
 * Not really relevant: Go is **cross plattform**. Theoretically, it could be used on Mac or Windows systems just as well as it can be on Linux.
 * Go’s binaries have quite the overhead (i.e. a lot of code being linked into the final executable). So letting a lot of applets share those linked routines (hopefully) cancels this drawback out.

## Vision
With GoBox a administrator should be able to **run a server**. All the **common service daemons** should be included, easy to configure and have a safe implementation. The **memory usage should be kept low** as well as **the size of the executable** it self. 

## Gained experience
### Static linking with Go
As it turns out, Go is not statically linked by default anymore. After spending some time trying to research the reason for this change, I found the answer in a post on [Go’s user mailing list][gonuts] which stated that they replaced their implementation of DNS lookup routines by links to the ones in the *glibc* for performance reasons (Unfortunately, I lost the link to that particual thread).  Of course, this requires dynamic linking. So the second I imported the `net` package, I got a dynamically linked executable.

Luckily, one of the follow-up posts showed how to revert to the old, self-written function of the Go library, effectively enabling static linking.  All I needed to do is disabling `cgo` (a meta-programmer for creating C-bindings in Go) when compiling the `net` package. The default Makefile made this fairly easy:

	$ cd $(GOROOT)/src/pkg/net
	$ make nuke
	$ CGO_ENABLED=0 make
	$ CGO_ENABLED=0 make install

Another thing I learned was that [XCode] which provides C/C++ compilers for Mac OS X does not include a `crt1.o`. Therefore, static linking is not possible on OS X. I cannot think of a single reason why Apple would actively prevent you from creating statically linked executables.
