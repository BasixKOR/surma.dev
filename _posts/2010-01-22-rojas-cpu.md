## The project
Not available.

## The idea
[Raúl Rojas][RaulRojas], my ALP I professor, published a remarkable [“tutorial”][RojasCPU], as he calls it.

In this tutorial, he describes a computer which constist of nothing more than memory, an instruction pointer which increments mercilessly and an ALU which is capable of nothing but [NAND]. Although every arithmetical operation can be emulated using only NAND operations, it seems like conditional branching is impossible; a vital ingredient to turing-completeness.

In this tutorial however he explains that, using artihmetics only, he is capable of *emulating* jumps. The paper is definitely worth a read.

Since every (arithmetical) operation has to be implemented manually bit by bit, programs for that cpu become fairly large and uneasy to read or manipulate. So as for every assembler language a compiler for some easier language is required. In this case I chose GOTO because it fits the underlying architecture. From there I might be able to bootstrap up to some well known (relatively) high-level language like C. If I remember correctly, there is a C-to-GOTO compiler somewhere out there.

## Decision for a technology
To build the processor I chose [Logisim]. It is basically an electrical circuit simulator without the drawbacks of actual physics simulation. It is all digital and optimized for logic and there is no parasitic inductances or anything like that. There are however some racey situations with this simulator, but it will do.

## Vision
The compiler has to be able to do 4 rather simple things:

 * Define a word length
 * have an arbitrary (but finite) number of registers
 * increase or decrease any of them by 1
 * jump to a label

That is it. Sounds doible, right?
