I learned a bit of arm64 (aarch64) and of course had to write it on the bare metal.

<!-- more -->

I wanted to understand the machine code WebAssembly runtimes like [v8] or [wasmtime] emit on my MacBook Air M1, and for that learned arm64 assembly (a bit). My colleague [Sa√∫l Cabrera][saul] recommended "Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language" by Stephen Smith, and I can only echo that recommendation.

The book does a great job of teaching the comparatively small instruction set, the optimization tricks as well as conventions and ABIs. However, it only makes you write programs against an operating system, not against a bare metal processor like you could do on a Rasperry Pi or similar. So that's what I wanted to do.

## Qemu

Because real hardware is annoyingly hard to bootstrap and debug, I am scoping this to a completely virtual platform. [Qemu] is my emulator of choice here as it can emulate a wide variety of processor architectures on a many different boards. For this, I'll use the [`virt`][virt] system that, while it is completely imaginary, is sufficiently well documented. For the CPU I'll use an Cortex-A72, mostly because that's the CPU that's in the [Rasperry Pi 400], which I eventually want to program this way.

The most important parts from the documentation are at the very end of the page:
* Flash memory starts at address `0x0000_0000`
* RAM starts at `0x4000_0000`
* The DTB is at the start of RAM, i.e. `0x4000_0000`

We will configure or instance to have 128MiB of RAM, so our usable memory addresses will go from `0x4000_0000` to `0x4800_0000`. More on the DTB later.

### Test program

 Without an operating system, you can't rely on good old `printf` debugging. There is nothing there that writes characters to the screen for you. Instead, we'll use the built-in capabilities that qemu offers to verify that our programs are working. At least intially.

To assemble our assembly code to binary machine code, we will use `as`. If you are on an M1 like me, you could use the system-provided `as`. However, the [binutils] that MacOS provides have been changed and are not as powerful as the GNU originals, so I recommend installing `aarch64-elf-binutils` via homebrew or building them yourself (although it's a bit tedious because of a bunch of dependencies I had to discover incrementally):

```
$ ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> --disable-gdb --target=aarch64-elf-linux
$ make
$ make install
# ... all tools will be in $PREFIX/bin
```

Here's a minimal program that puts a specific value into one of the CPU's register and then loops forever. 

```armasm
# main.s

.global _reset
_reset:
	# Set up stack pointer
	LDR X2, =stack_top
  MOV SP, X2
	# Magic number
	MOV X13, #0x1337
	# Loop endlessly
	B . 
```

We can turn this into an object files as follows:

```
$ as -o main.o main.s
```

in the next step we need to link our object file into the final machine code using `ld`. By default, `ld` is configured to create an executable conforming to certain operating system defaults. We don't want any of that, so we have to write our own linker script. Linker scripts are very weird in my opinion, and I haven't fully understood them, despite finding the [documentation][linker scripts].

The following linker script will adjust our machine code that it has the assumption baked in that it will be loaded at `0x4010_0000`, so 1MiB after the ominous DTB. It also defines the `stack_top` symbol to point 4KiB afer our code ended, which means we have 4KiB of stack space. We won't be using the stack, but it's always good to set it up so that something as basic as a function call works correctly.
 
```
/* linker.ld */
SECTIONS {
 . = 0x40100000;
 .text : { *(.text) }
 . = ALIGN(8);
 . = . + 0x1000; 
 stack_top = .;
}
```

Let's link our code:

```
$ ld -T linker.ld -o main.elf main.o
```

To verify that this worked correctly, we can use `objdump`:

```
$ objdump -d kernel.elf

main.elf:     file format elf64-littleaarch64

Disassembly of section .text:

0000000040100000 <_reset>:
    40100000:   d28266ed        mov     x13, #0x1337                    // #4919
    40100004:   14000000        b       40100004 <_reset+0x4>
```

Now we have an [ELF] file, but we won't have an operating system that can decode that format to load the instruction into memory. To extract the raw binary instructions, `objcopy` comes in handy:

```
$ objcopy -O binary main.elf main.bin
```

Instead of dealing with BIOSes or boot sectors and other shenanigans, we'll use Qemu's [generic loader] functionality to load files into memory:

```
$ qemu-system-aarch64 \
	-M virt -cpu cortex-a72 \
	-m 128M -nographic \
	-device loader,file=kernel.bin,addr=0x40100000 \
	-device loader,addr=0x40100000,cpu-num=0
```

The first `-device` directive loads a file into memory at the specific address. The second `-device` directive sets the CPUs starting address.

Of course, there won't be any output. But we can open Qemu's console using `[Ctrl+a][c]` and use the `info registers` command to dump the current contents of the CPU registers.

(qemu) q
```

`X13` contains `0x1337`, so our program is indeed running!

### Touch my 'elf

There is no operating system that can decode ELF files, but Qemu can, and it can load an ELF file into memory as it is prescribed! This allows us to simplify the our invocation, but would also allow us to use more complicated linker script setups in the future:

```
$ qemu-system-aarch64 \
	-M virt -cpu cortex-a72 \
	-m 128M -nographic \
	-device loader,file=kernel.elf \
	-device loader,addr=0x40100000,cpu-num=0
```

## Debugging

Putting magic values into registers is as close as we'll get to `printf` debugging, but nothing beats step debugging when writing assembly. You can use `gdb` step through the system emulated by Qemu, but `gdb` does note support the M1 platform. Luckily, `lldb` understands gdb-style remote debugging as well. We can start Qemu with gdb remote debugging enabled (`-S`), and tell it to wait with starting the system (`-s`).

```
$ qemu-system-aarch64 \
	-M virt -cpu cortex-a72 \
	-m 128M -nographic \
	-device loader,file=kernel.elf \
	-device loader,addr=0x40100000,cpu-num=0 \
	-s -S
```

Now we start `lldb` to connect:

```
$ lldb kernel.elf
(lldb) gdb-remote localhost:1234                                                                                                                                      Process 1 stopped
* thread #1, stop reason = signal SIGTRAP
    frame #0: 0x0000000040100000 kernel.elf`_reset
kernel.elf`_reset:
->  0x40100000 <+0>: mov    x13, #0x1337
    0x40100004 <+4>: b      0x40100004                ; <+4>
    0x40100008:      udf    #0x0
    0x4010000c:      udf    #0x0
Target 0: (kernel.elf) stopped.
```

Now we have the full power of a debugger. Stepping, break points, memory and register inspection,... you name it.

## Serial I/O

From the documentatoin of the `virt` platform, we know that it comes with a PL011 chip to handle the UART port (also called "serial port"). This seems like the easiest way to generate some output.

Looking at [the manual][pl011], we can write data to a register called `UARTDR` to send something over the serial port. The register has an offset of `0x000` from the PL011's base address, but what is the base address? That changes from system to system and needs to be determined at runtime.

## Device Tree

The [Device Tree] is an open specification for a binary format and a text format to describe what periherals a system has and how to access them. The `virt` documentation said that the DTB, short for "Device Tree Blob", will be at the start of the RAM. 

While the correct thing to do would be to write code to parse the DTB, for now we are going to settle with dumping the DTB to disk using `lldb` and extracting the relevant information:

```
(lldb) memory read --force -o dump.dtb -b 0x40000000 0x40000000+1024*1024
```

The dump contains the binary format. By installing `dtc` via homebrew, we can convert between the binary and the text format:

```
$ dtc dump.dtb
/dts-v1/;

/ {
        interrupt-parent = <0x8002>;
        model = "linux,dummy-virt";
        #size-cells = <0x02>;
        #address-cells = <0x02>;
        compatible = "linux,dummy-vi
...
```

There will be a lot of data in there, but most interestingly, there will be this section:

```
pl011@9000000 {
        clock-names = "uartclk\0apb_pclk";
        clocks = <0x8000 0x8000>;
        interrupts = <0x00 0x01 0x04>;
        reg = <0x00 0x9000000 0x00 0x1000>;
        compatible = "arm,pl011\0arm,primecell";
};
```

The base address of the PL011 is `0x900_0000`, which means our `UARTDR` register is also at `0x900_0000`. Let's write something to it:

```armasm
.global _reset
_reset:
	LDR X10, UARTDR
	MOV W9, '!'
	STRB W9, [X10]
	B . 
UARTDR: 
	.quad 0x9000000
```

This writes the ASCII code for `'!'` into `UARTDR`, and Qemu should output it to your shell.
