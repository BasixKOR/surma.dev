The (un)original idea
=================

The urge to have a list of all the project ideas I have ever had is as old as it is boring.

During the first years at [university](http://www.fu-berlin.de "The university I study CS at"),
a few colleagues and I came up with so many ideas for projects each day that it was impossible
to keep track of them and soon most of them had been forgotten and never been worked on.

At some point, whenever one of us came up with a new idea, we would just say

> Another project that’s gonna be engraved on your tombstone

From that point on, I spent a lot of time designing and developing my new webpage which I was convinced
was going to be called *Surma’s Tombstone*. The first versions never saw the light of day and were
mere experiments with new web technologies. I guess after about 2 years of playing around and being frustrated,
I felt comfortable enough with the intertubes and its quirks to give this project another go.

So much had changed since I first had the idea that I decided to (slightly) change the name into
*Surma’s Obituary Column* which had the nice side-effect of somewhat answering the design question.

The projects
============

Each project gets its own obituary. I will try to describe its most interesting aspects in the
one-liner below the name of each project.
The project’s day of death is the day I came up with the idea (or remembered to write it down).
The project’s day of birth is the day I actually started to work on it.
I did it this way, because then *“the project being born”* actually makes sense.

If you have ideas, additions, corrections or criticism – be that on some existing entry or a completely
new one – feel free to leave a comment below that project or write me an e-mail [alexander.surma@gmail.com](mailto:alexander.surma@gmail.com "My e-mail address").
